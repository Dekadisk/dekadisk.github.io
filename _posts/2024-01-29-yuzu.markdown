I spent a few months working as a gameplay and engine programmer for Yuzu, a Parisian start-up working on an Unreal Engine-based game which aims at evaluating candidates' soft skills as a part of recruitement processes.

My work involved:
- implementing camera and mouse-related features
- implementing the game narrative logic for new parts of the game
- fixing bugs, of course!
- implementing tools (including some using [MothCocoon's FlowGraph](https://github.com/MothCocoon/FlowGraph) as a basis
- reviewing and updating the entire game code to eliminate technical debt
- create all the tools and functionalities required for the logic and implementation of new puzzles in version 2.0 of the game
