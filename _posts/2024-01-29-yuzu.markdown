I spent a few months working as a gameplay and engine programmer for Yuzu, a Parisian start-up working on an Unreal Engine-based game which aims at evaluating candidates' soft skills as a part of recruitement processes.

My work involved:
- implementing camera and mouse-related features
- reworking game narrative logic for parts of the game
- fixing bugs, of course!
- implementing tools and plugins
- reviewing and updating the entire game code to eliminate technical debt and be future-proof
