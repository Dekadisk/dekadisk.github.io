I am currently developing Black Fountain, an interactive text adventure for smartphones that offers a choice-based experience. This game, heavily influenced by the Lifeline series, will be available in both French and English. In Black Fountain, players engage in real-time conversations with a character who inhabits a unique world. Through notifications, players are informed when the character wishes to communicate, allowing them to interact and guide the character towards making crucial decisions for survival.

I hope to have it done by the end of june, but for now, here are some early screenshots:
