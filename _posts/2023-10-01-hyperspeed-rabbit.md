Hyperspeed Rabbit is a video game project using a custom engine. As a part of the team that worked on it, I worked primarily as an engine/gameplay programmer and a game designer. Hyperspeed Rabbit was developed using DirectX and PhysX only - it uses our own engine! The project can be downloaded on my Github, [here](https://github.com/Dekadisk/HyperspeedRabbit).
