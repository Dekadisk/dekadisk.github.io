Hyperspeed Rabbit is a video game project using a custom engine.  As a member of the team involved in its creation, my primary roles encompassed engine and gameplay programming, along with game design responsibilities. Hyperspeed Rabbit was developed using **DirectX** and **PhysX**, all within the confines of our own engine. You can access and download the project from my Github repository, available [here](https://github.com/Dekadisk/HyperspeedRabbit).
