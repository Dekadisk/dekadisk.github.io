I am part of the team that worked on the 3D mutiplayer game "Prisonniers des Songes". I worked primarily as the **game designer (technical designer) and gameplay programmer**, and we put in a lot of effort to make it happen. [Here is the Github link!](https://github.com/Dekadisk/PrisonniersDesSonges)

_The creation of this game involved C++ programming and scripting with blueprints in Unreal Engine 4, as well as the incorporation of Wwise for audio functions._
