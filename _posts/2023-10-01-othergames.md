__Used for these projects__: *Godot, GDScript, LUA, Love2D engine*

This page features *very* small projects made with Godot and LUA, which do not deserve their own article. All of them were used as learning tools.

Here's a very simple project made to learn how to use Godot and its GDScript.

Here are two games that I used to learn LUA, using the Love2D game engine. The first one is a very simple shoot-em-up, while the other one is a platformer, with physics and horrific goombas.
