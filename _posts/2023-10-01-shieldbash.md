__Used for this project__: *C++, Unreal Engine 5*

SHIELDBASH is an UE5 project. In SHIELDBASH, the player has to make their way through hordes of enemies, armed with only a shield and a grappling hook. Forget shooting your enemies ; you now have to deflect their projectiles back at them, throw them into lava, or hurt them with crates thrown with your shield. Platforming is also an important part of this speedrun-friendly game. 

SHIELDBASH is heavily inspired by retroFPS games such as Doom and Wolfenstein, and arcade games such has Anger Foot.

_Please note that screenshots provided are from levels specifically built to show mechanics. These levels - and the very basic textures used to showcase the features - are not in the final (short) game._

## Grappling hook

Forget Just Cause-style grappling hooks ; here, using yours makes you swing, not dash forward!

## Shield bashing

Not having a firearm doesn't mean you're powerless. Thanks to your might shield, throw enemies into the void, traps, or deflect their projectiles right back at them! You can also use your shield bash on the environment - who doesn't like throwing crates and explosive barrels at their enemies?

## Stomping and jumping

Stomp the ground after a double jump, or jump on your enemies' heads with your shield, which will reset your jumps!
