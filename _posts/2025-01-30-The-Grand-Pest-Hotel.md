__Used for this project__: *C++, Unreal Engine 5, Slate*


The [Grand Pest Hotel](https://feykowo.itch.io/grand-pest-hotel) is a game made for the 1-Button Game Jam 2024 by an awesome team of people. I worked on it as a designer, general programmer, gameplay programmer (mechanics related to the elevator and its feel), UI designer (main menu, upgrade menu) and UI programmer, with UE's Slate. The game is free to play on [itch.io](https://feykowo.itch.io/grand-pest-hotel).
