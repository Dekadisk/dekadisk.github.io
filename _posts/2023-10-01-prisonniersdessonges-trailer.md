I played a key role in the team that brought the 3D multiplayer game 'Prisonniers des Songes' to life. I took on the roles of game designer (technical designer) and gameplay programmer, putting in a lot of effort to make it happen. 
My responsibilities encompassed gameplay programming and game design (technical design). Feel free to explore the Github link for further details! [Here is the Github link!](https://github.com/Dekadisk/PrisonniersDesSonges)
