__Used for this project__: *C++, Unreal Engine 4, database, 3d maths, procedural generation, multiplayer features*

I played a key role in the team that brought the 3D multiplayer game 'Prisonniers des Songes' to life. I took on the roles of game designer (technical designer) and gameplay programmer. 
My responsibilities encompassed gameplay programming and game design (technical design). All interactables and tools in the game are my creations (wardrobes, chalks, traps), but I also worked on the game's maze's generation, its IA, and its general game design.
