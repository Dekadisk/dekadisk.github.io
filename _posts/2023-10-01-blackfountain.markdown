I am currently developing Black Fountain, an interactive text adventure for smartphones that offers a choice-based experience. This game, heavily influenced by the Lifeline series, will be available in both French and English. In Black Fountain, players engage in real-time conversations with a character who inhabits a unique world. Through notifications, players are informed when the character wishes to communicate, allowing them to interact and guide the character towards making crucial decisions for survival.

For now, here are some early screenshots, with placeholder text, to showcase the UI:

Black Fountain itself and the companion app used to write the story are developed with Unity. No ETA, as writing the story is currently not my priority.
